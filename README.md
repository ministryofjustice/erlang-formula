erlang-formula
==============

This is a very simple Salt formula responsible solely for installing
Erlang/OTP packages using official builds from Erlang Solutions.

Why? Because Erlang version available in the official Debian and/or
Ubuntu repositories is rather old, bug ridden, etc.

To use this Salt formula, simply include it.
